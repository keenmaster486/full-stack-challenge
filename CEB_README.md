To the Techstars team:

This readme will document my process as I build this application.

I have actually not built anything full stack with Rails before,
so this will be a journey.


----NOTE----
All comments from me are prefixed with "CEB"
------------


The app needs a backend and a frontend; the backend will be built
in Ruby on Rails and contained in the directory "ruby-backend".
The frontend is built in React and will be contained in the
directory "react-frontend".

--Installed Ruby 2.6.3 with rbenv and installed Rails
--Installed SQLite 3 for the DB (after failed first attempt)
--Installed Yarn (after failed first attempt)
--Created new Rails app in ruby-backend
--Verify it works; default "Puma" server is up and running

Excluding online tutorials for MVC because this is only an API, no views.

--Changed the Ruby app to API only
--Got a simple root controller and status route up and running!
